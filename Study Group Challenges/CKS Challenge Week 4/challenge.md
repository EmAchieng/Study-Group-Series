## Challenge 4

Challenge : Secure Kubernetes Cluster Setup on Ubuntu with OpenVPN and UFW

Install a Kubernetes cluster with one master and one worker node on Ubuntu, secure the network with ufw, and ensure that the cluster is only accessible via a private network using OpenVPN. Provide controlled access to developers through OpenVPN and kubeconfig. If needed, you can use virtual machines on AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.​

1. Install Kubernetes on Ubuntu

Set up two Ubuntu servers (subnet 10.10.1.0/24) — one for the master node and one for the worker node. Install Docker or a container runtime of your choice on both nodes. Install kubeadm, kubectl, and kubelet on both nodes. Initialize the Kubernetes cluster on the master node using kubeadm init. Join the worker node to the cluster using the token generated by the master node.

2. Configure UFW to Secure the Cluster

Install ufw on both the master and worker nodes. Configure ufw to permit only the necessary Kubernetes ports and SSH on both the master and worker nodes. Specifically, allow access to the Kubernetes API server from the developers connected through the OpenVPN subnet (10.10.1.0/24), ensuring secure and restricted connectivity.

3. Provide Developer Access

Distribute kubeconfig files to developers, configured to work over the VPN network. Ensure the kubeconfig files are set to use the internal IP addresses of the Kubernetes API server. Provide them with access to the cluster, allowing them to monitor deployments, examine pods, and retrieve pod logs.
