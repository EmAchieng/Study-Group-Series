## Resources for Completing the Onboarding
### Code of Conduct
KodeKloud Ambassadors enthusiastically impart their expertise to their peers. We also want our ambassadors to embody certain standards and positively display community spirit by conducting themselves with respect and restraint whenever they engage with people, inside and outside the program. Being a budding technologist who can speak to the larger community is not enough - we care deeply about a person's character and leadership skills.
